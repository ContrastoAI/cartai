This involves leveraging various components to ensure that documentation is not only comprehensive but also easily maintainable and adaptable.\\n\\n### Project Structure\\n\\nThe codebase is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:\\n\\n| Folder      | Purpose                              |\\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |\\n| `adapters/` | Thin, interchangeable tools          |\\n| `cli/`      | Lightweight user entry points        |\\n| `core/`     | Pure logic, no external dependencies |\\n| `lineage/`  | High-level lineage coordination      |\\n| `llm_agents/` | LLM-based logic only               |\\n| `tests/`    | Developer trust & confidence         |\\n| `examples/` | Fast time-to-first-success           |\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nTo set up the `cartai` project, you need to have Python 3.12 or higher installed on your machine. The project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/) as the package manager.\\n\\n1. Clone the repository:\\n   ```bash\\n   git clone https://www.github.com/ContrastoAI/cartai.git\\n   cd cartai\\n   ```\\n\\n2. Install the dependencies:\\n   ```bash\\n   uv install\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Alternatively, you can install the package in editable mode for development:\\n   ```bash\\n   uv pip install -e .\\n   ```\\n\\n4. Ensure that `pre-commit` is installed for maintaining code quality:\\n   ```bash\\n   uv run .pre-commit\\n   ```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThe `cartai` package can be run from the command line. You can generate documentation using the following command:\\n\\n```bash\\nuv run cartai readme --description \"Crafting intelligent E2E documentation for trustworthy AI.\" --code \".\" --output \"README.md\"\\n```\\n\\nThis will create a `README.md` file based on the specified input and template.\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nContributions are welcome! If you would like to help improve `cartai`, please follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Fork the repository.\\n2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:\\n   ```bash\\n   git checkout -b feature/my-feature\\n   ```\\n3. Make your changes and commit them:\\n   ```bash\\n   git commit -m \"Add my feature\"\\n   ```\\n4. Push your changes:\\n   ```bash\\n   git push origin feature/my-feature\\n   ```\\n5. Submit a pull request.\\n\\nThank you for considering contributing to `cartai`! Your efforts help improve the project and assist others in the AI community.\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThis project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
